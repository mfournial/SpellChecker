#SpellChecker
SpellChecker is a very fast way of checking the spelling of you documents.
For now, it takes a doc (eg .txt file) as an argument and outputs the misspelled words.
  
### Example:   
>Reading from: src/example.txt  
 Numbers of words checked: 48  
 Numbers of words in dictionary: 354975  
 Misspelled words:  
 writtten   
 'text  
 deected  
 theee  
 'dont'  
 'dont  
 onkey  
 onkey  

### Acknowledgement 
SpellChecker was from a coursework done for CS50 written in C at the time.

##Known bugs and Issues
Numbers are not checked (like 1st), so are special characters. 
No UnitTests have been written yet.

##What's next for Spellchecker
Integrate it in a software or a GUI to do continuous spellchecking, which is what it is the best at.
